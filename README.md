# CUI-project-java
HospitalManagementSystem (MVC pattern)

Database I used Mysql
    There are four tables should be created in the database:
           1.Patient table
           2.Treatment table
           3.Physician table
           4.Room table
           
In my java CUI project,

      In TREATMENT TABLE:
      It will ask to "Please select one of the below options"
		          1 for "Add Treatment" in DB
		          2 for "Fetch Treatment by treatment id" from DB
		          3 for "Fetch Treatment by Disease" from DB
		          4 for "Update Treatment Details" from DB
		          5 for "Generate Bill" from DB (perform Joins)
		          6 for "Exit"
              
     In PATIENT TABLE:      
      It will ask to "Please select one of the below options"
		          1 for "Add Patient" in DB
		          2 for "Fetch Patient by Patient id" from DB
		          3 for "Fetch Patient by Disease" from DB
		          4 for "Update Patient Details" from DB
              5 for "Exit"
              
THESE SAME COMMANDS CAN BE PERFORMED FOR REMAINING TWO TABLES (i.e) PHYSICIAN TABLE AND ROOM TABLE
